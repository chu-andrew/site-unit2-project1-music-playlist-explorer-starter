### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs generally prepared me to complete the assignment, especially the design of HTML+CSS elements and the use of JavaScript to add interactivity. However, one of the features I had to research further before implementing was the dynamic creation of elements (e.g. playlist cards/modals) based on data from a JSON file. I eventually went with an approach the intermixed JavaScript with some HTML in order to dynamically generate elements with the given data, which helped me see the motivation for libraries such as React.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have prioritized cleaner code and frontend design if I had more time. Although I was able to implement the core and stretch features, I felt that the limited time meant that these features came at the cost of clean code and detailed fronted design. Also, since this was my first time working with vanilla JS + HTML + CSS, I wasn't quite sure of the best practices, and so I ended up writing messy code.

One of the biggest challenges I faced this week was prioritizing important tasks and planning ahead during the development process. In retrospect, I should have read through the design requirements more carefully so that I would not have to make excessive design changes during the execution process. Also, I learned the importance of prioritizing features ahead of styling changes--- I realized in the middle of the week that I had shifted too much time to the HTML+CSS design (our first task), instead of implementing all of the core+stretch features before going back and tweaking the styling. I'll be going into next week's project and also the capstone project with a strong focus on the planning stages and being more cognizant of which areas to prioritize spending my development time.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I enjoyed both presenting my project and seeing other interns' approach to the project. I saw many UI elements that were much more polished than my versions, and I would like to bring that same level of detailing to my future projects. Also, I noticed that some other projects tended to utilize a higher degree of JavaScript functionality (e.g. filter, map instead of looping) in comparison to my project. I think familiarity with JS will come with time and practice using these functions for projects.

### Open-source libraries used

No open-source libraries used. 
Font Awesome free icon library used for like, delete, and edit icons on playlist cards.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

German and George were helpful in the debugging process of some CSS quirks, like the scrolling modals and centered playlist cards.
